I'm thrilled to share that our project, a **custom MLIR dialect for debugging and instrumenting IRs generated by compiler passes**, was selected as a **finalist at [Segfault Compiler Hackathon](https://segfault.compilertech.org/)**! ðŸš€  

This dialect makes it easier to observe and analyze transformations across different stages of the MLIR pipeline, helping developers better understand and debug their conversions/transformations.  

It was an incredible experience to showcase this work and exchange ideas with the community.
