I'm excited to share that I presented my work at the [PLDI 2025 Student Research Competition (SRC)](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2025-src)!  
My extended abstract was published in the PLDI 2025 proceedings, and I had a wonderful opportunity to engage with researchers in programming languages and systems.

ðŸŽ‰ I was also honored to receive the [PLMW (Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop)](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/track/PLMW-PLDI-2025) scholarship.
