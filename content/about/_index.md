I like building things: compilers, hardware, and everything in between. I work on generating efficient code and systems from high-level abstractions using LLVM and MLIR. I have also created several MLIR dialects, some for fun and some for research.

I am interested in problems at the intersection of programming languages, hardware, and performance. I like exploring how far we can push the art code generation.
