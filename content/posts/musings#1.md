Today, the world pauses.
We lost a shepherd, a father, a quiet strength — our beloved Pope has gone home.

And in this moment, I'm reminded how some stories… don’t end.
They simply change form.
Like a soft candle flickering out, not into darkness, but into something eternal.

We often seek closure — in people, in relationships, in moments.
But maybe beauty lies in the unfinished. In the half-spoken goodbyes, in silent prayers, in the gentle presence that lingers even after someone is gone.

His story may feel like it ended today.
But the truth is, it lives on — in every soul he inspired, in every heart he helped lift.
Just as some people leave our lives quietly, not with full stops, but with ellipses…
Their story lives within us, woven into the very fabric of who we are.

Some stories remain unfinished.
And maybe… that’s what makes them eternal.
